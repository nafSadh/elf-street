      "Name": "Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss.\nInternational Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns.\nInvesting in high yield fixed income securities, otherwise known as \"junk bonds\", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These Lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.\nEquity securities may fluctuate in value in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.\nThere are risks associated with investing in Real Assets and the Real Assets sector, including real estate, precious metals and natural resources.  Investments can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries.\nInvesting in foreign domiciled securities may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, withholding taxes, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations.
